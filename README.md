#   RGB2Gray 

This project demonstrates image processing in MATLAB by extracting and visualizing individual color channels (Red, Green, Blue) and converting images to grayscale. The script reads an input image, isolates specific color channels by manipulating pixel values, and displays the results for analysis. It also showcases grayscale conversion using the rgb2gray function.

Features Extract Red, Green, and Blue channels. Convert images to grayscale using two methods. Usage Place an image file (e.g., car.jpg) in the script's directory, run it in MATLAB, and view the output visualizations.



# Image Histogram Equalization in MATLAB

This repository demonstrates the process of **image histogram equalization**, a powerful technique for enhancing image contrast by redistributing pixel intensities.

### Features:
1. Manual Implementation**:  
   - Step-by-step computation of histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDF).  
   - Application of normalized CDF to transform pixel values and achieve equalization.  
   - Ideal for learning the mathematical foundation of histogram equalization.

2. Built-in Function**:  
   - Utilizes MATLABâ€™s `histeq` function for quick and efficient histogram equalization.  
   - Suitable for practical applications where computational efficiency is essential.  

### Visualization:  
Both scripts include visual comparisons of:  
- Original and equalized images.  
- Their histograms and CDFs.  

This repository serves as an excellent resource for students and professionals aiming to understand and apply histogram equalization in image processing tasks.  

Feel free to explore and modify the scripts to suit your projects. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
