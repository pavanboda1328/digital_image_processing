##---------RGB2Gray--------## This project demonstrates image processing in MATLAB by extracting and visualizing individual color channels (Red, Green, Blue) and converting images to grayscale. The script reads an input image, isolates specific color channels by manipulating pixel values, and displays the results for analysis. It also showcases grayscale conversion using the rgb2gray function.

Features Extract Red, Green, and Blue channels. Convert images to grayscale using two methods. Usage Place an image file (e.g., car.jpg) in the script's directory, run it in MATLAB, and view the output visualizations.
